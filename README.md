## What is winimal?
Widgets in your terminal!

Most times you want small widgets to keep an eye on things. The problem is every
platform is different, however, they mostly share a type of terminal.

This project will allow you to create, customize, and run widgets inside any
type of terminals.

You can always create a new issue if you need any help, or have any bugs to
report.
